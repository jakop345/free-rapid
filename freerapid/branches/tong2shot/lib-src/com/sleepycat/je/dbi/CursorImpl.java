     * The cursor must initially be uninitialized.
     *
     * Called by all the Cursor.putXXX() ops, except putCurrent().
     *
     * @param key The new key value for the BIN slot S to be inserted/updated.
     * Cannot be partial. For dups DBs it is a 2-part key combining the
     * original, user-provided key and data. In case of update, "key" must
     * compare equal to S.key (otherwise DuplicateDataException is thrown),
     * but the 2 keys may not be identical if custom comparators are used.
     * So, S.key will actually be replaced by "key".
     *
     * @param data In case of update, the new data to (perhaps partially)
     * replace the data of the LN associated with the BIN slot. For dups DBs
     * it is EMPTY_DUPS_DATA. Note: for dups DBs the original, user-provided
     * "data" must not be partial.
     *
     * @param ln is normally a new LN node that is created for insertion, and
     * will be discarded if an update occurs.  However, HA will pass an
     * existing node.
     *
     * @param putMode OVERWRITE or NO_OVERWRITE
     *
     * @param returnOldData To receive, in case of update, the old LN data
     * (before the update). It is needed only by DBs with indexes/triggers;
     * will be null otherwise.
     *
     * @param returnNewData To receive the full data of the new or updated LN.
     * It is needed only by DBs with indexes/triggers and only if "data" is
     * partial; will be null otherwise. Note: "returnNewData" may be different
     * than "data" only if "data" is partial.
     *
     * @param opStats Used to collect stats about user ops performed on BIN
     * deltas. Internal ops should pass null.

     *                   BIN-3                BIN-4
     *
     * Initially, the tree looks as above and a cursor (C) is located on the
     * last slot of BIN-3. For simplicity, assume no duplicates and no
     * serializable isolation. Also assume that C is a sticky cursor.
     *
     * 1. Thread 1 calls C.getNext(), which calls retrieveNextAllowPhantoms(),
     *    which duplicates C's cursorImpl, and calls dup.getNext().
     *
     *    dup.getNext() latches BIN-3, sets dup.binToBeRemoved to BIN-3 and
     *    then calls Tree.getNextBin(BIN-3).
     *
     *    Tree.getNextBin(BIN-3) does the following:
     *    - sets searchKey to 85
     *    - calls Tree.getParentINForChildIN(BIN-3).
     *    - Tree.getParentINForChildIN(BIN-3) unlatches BIN-3 and searches for
     *       BIN-3 parent, thus reaching IN-1.
     *    - IN-1.findEntry(85) sets "index" to 2,
     *    - "index" is incremented,
     *    - "moreEntriesThisIn" is set to false,
     *    - "next" is set to IN-1, .
     *    - Tree.getParentINForChildIN(IN-1) is called and unlatches IN-1.
     *
     *    Assume at this point thread 1 looses the cpu.
     *
     * 2. Thread 2 inserts keys 90 and 95, causing a split of both BIN-3 and
     *    IN-1. So the tree now looks like this:
     *
     *                       IN-0

     *                     BIN-3             BIN-6         BIN-4
     *
     *
     *    Notice that C.cursorImpl still points to the last slot of BIN-3.
     *
     * 3. Thread 1 resumes:
     *
     *    - Tree.getParentINForChildIN(IN-1) reaches IN-0.
     *    - IN-0.findEntry(85) sets "index" to 2,
     *    - "index" is incremented,
     *    - "nextIN" is set to IN-2, which is latched.
     *    - Tree.searchSubTree(IN-2, LEFT) is called, and returns BIN-4.
     *    - BIN-4 is the result of Tree.getNextBin(BIN-3), i.e., BIN-6 was
     *      skipped
     *
     *      Now we are back in dup.getNext():
     *    - dup.bin is set to BIN-4, dup.index to -1, and dup is added to BIN-4
     *    - the while loop repeats, dup.index is set to 0, the 1st slot of
     *      BIN-4 is locked, and dup.getNext() returns SUCCESS.
     *
     *      Now we are back in C.retrieveNextAllowPhantoms():
     *    - C.checkForInsertion() is called
     *    - C.cursorImpl and dup are on different BINs, but the condition:
     *      origBIN.getNEntries() - 1 > origCursor.getIndex()
     *      is false, so C.checkForInsertion() returns false.
     *
     * The end result is that BIN-6 has been missed. This is not be a "bug" for
     * non-serializable isolation, but the above scenario applies to
     * serializable isolation as well, and in that case, BIN-6 should really
     * not be missed. This could be solved by re-implementing
     * Tree.getNext/PrevBIN() do a more "logical" kind of search.

     *
     * Preconditions: The BIN must be latched.
     *
     * Postconditions: The BIN is latched.
     *
     * LN Locking Rules
     * ----------------
     * The lock ID for an LN is its LSN in the parent BIN slot.  Because the
     * LSN changes when logging the LN, only two methods of locking an LN may
     * be used to support concurrent access:
     *
     * 1. This method may be called to lock the old LSN.  For read operations,
     * that is all that is necessary.  For write operations, the new LSN must
     * be locked after logging it, which is done by all the LN logging methods.
     * Be sure to pass a non-null locker to the LN logging method to lock the
     * LN, unless locking is not desired.
     *
     * 2. A non-blocking lock may be obtained on the old LSN (using
     * Locker.nonBlockingLock rather than this method), as long as the lock is
     * released before the BIN latch is released.  In this case a null locker
     * is passed to the LN logging method; locking the new LSN is unnecessary
     * because no other thread can access the new LSN until the BIN latch is
     * released.
     *
     * The first method is used for all user operations.  The second method is
     * used by the cleaner, when flushing dirty deferred-write LNs, and by
     * certain btree operations.
     *
     * Uncontended Lock Optimization
     * -----------------------------
     * The allowUncontended param is passed as true for update and delete
     * operations as an optimization for the case where no lock on the old LSN
     * is held by any locker.  In this case we don't need to lock the old LSN
     * at all, as long as we log the new LSN before releasing the BIN latch.
     *
     * 1. Latch BIN
     * 2. Determine that no lock/waiter exists for oldLsn
     * 3. Log LN and get lsn
     * 4. Lock lsn
     * 5. Update BIN
     * 6. Release BIN latch
     *
     * The oldLsn is never locked, saving operations on the lock table.  The
     * assumption is that another locker will first have to latch the BIN to
     * get oldLsn, before requesting a lock.
     *
     * A potential problem is that the other locker may release the BIN latch
     * before requesting the lock.
     *
     * This Operation        Another Operation
     * --------------        -----------------
     *                       Latch BIN, get oldLsn, release BIN latch
     * Step 1 and 2
     *                       Request lock for oldLsn, granted
     * Step 3 and 4
     *
     * Both operations now believe they have an exclusive lock, but they have
     * locks on different LSNs.
     *
     * However, this problem is handled as long as the other lock is performed
     * using a lockLN method in this class, which will release the lock and
     * retry if the LSN changes while acquiring the lock.  Because it
     * re-latches the BIN to check the LSN, this will serialize access to the
     * LSN for locking, guaranteeing that two conflicting locks cannot be
     * granted on the old and new LSNs.
     *
     * Deferred-Write Locking
     * ----------------------
     * When one of the LN optionalLog methods is called, a deferred-write LN is
     * dirtied but not actually logged.  In order to lock an LN that has been
     * inserted but not yet assigned a true LSN, a transient LSNs is assigned.
     * These LSNs serve to lock the LN but never appear in the log.  See
     * LN.assignTransientLsn.
     *
     * A deferred-write LN is logged when its parent BIN is logged, or when the
     * LN is evicted.  This will replace transient LSNs with durable LSNs.  If
     * a lock is held by a cursor on a deferred-write LN when it is logged, the
     * same lock is acquired on the new LSN by the cursor.  See
     * lockAfterLsnChange.
     *
     * Cleaner Migration Locking
     * -------------------------
     * The cleaner takes a non-blocking read lock on the old LSN before
     * migrating/logging the LN, while holding the BIN latch.  It does not take
     * a lock on the new LSN, since it does not need to retain a lock after
     * releasing the BIN latch.
     *
     * Because a read, not write, lock is taken, other read locks may be held
     * during migration.  After logging, the cleaner calls lockAfterLsnChange
     * to lock the new LSN on behalf of other lockers.
     *
     * For more info on migration locking, see HandleLocker.
     *
     * Historical Notes
     * ----------------
     * In JE 4.1 and earlier, each LN had a node ID that was used for locking,
     * rather than using the LSN.  The node ID changed only if a deleted slot
     * was reused.  The node ID was stored in the LN, requiring that the LN be
     * fetched when locking the LN.  With LSN locking a fetch is not needed.
     *
     * When LN node IDs were used, deferred-write LNs were not assigned an LSN
     * until they were actually logged. Deferred-write LNs were initially
     * assigned a null LSN and transient LSNs were not needed.
     *
     * @param lockType the type of lock requested.
     *
     * @param allowUncontended is true to return immediately (no lock is taken)
     * when no locker holds or waits for the lock.
     *
     * @param noWait is true to perform a no-wait lock request while keeping
     * the BIN latched.  The caller must check the lock result to see whether
     * the lock was granted.
     *
     * @return all information about the lock; see LockStanding.
     *
     * @throws LockConflictException if the lsn is non-null, the lock is
     * contended, and a lock could not be obtained by blocking.
