/**
 *
 * Overview
 * --------
 *
 * The Evictor is responsible for managing the JE cache. The cache is
 * actually a collection of in-memory btree nodes, implemented by the
 * com.sleepycat.je.dbi.INList class. A subset of the nodes in te INList
 * are candidates for eviction. This subset is tracked in one or more
 * LRULists, which are maintained by the Evictor. When a node is evicted,
 * it is detached from its containing BTree and then removed from the INList
 * and from its containing LRUList. Once all references to an evicted node
 * are removed, it can be GC'd by the JVM.
 *
 * The Evictor owns a pool of threads that are available to handle eviction
 * tasks. The eviction pool is a standard java.util.concurrent thread pool,
 * and can be mutably configured in terms of core threads, max threads, and
 * keepalive times.
 *
 * Eviction is carried out by three types of threads:
 * 1. An application thread, in the course of doing critical eviction.
 * 2. Daemon threads, such as the cleaner or INCompressor, in the course of
 *    doing their respective duties.
 * 3. Eviction pool threads.
 *
 * Memory consumption is tracked by the MemoryBudget. The Arbiter, which is
 * also owned by the Evictor, is used to query the MemoryBudget and determine
 * whether eviction is actually needed, and if so, how many bytes should be
 * evicted by an evicting thread.
 *
 * Multiple threads can do eviction concurrently. As a result, it's important
 * that eviction is both thread safe and as parallel as possible.  Memory
 * thresholds are generally accounted for in an unsynchronized fashion, and are
 * seen as advisory. The only point of true synchronization is around the
 * selection of a node for eviction. The act of eviction itself can be done
 * concurrently.
 *
 * The eviction method is not reentrant, and a simple concurrent hash map
 * of threads is used to prevent recursive calls.
 *
 * Details on the implementation of the LRU-based eviction policy
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * ------------------
 * Data structures
 * ------------------
 *
 * An LRU eviction policy is approximated by one or more LRULists. An LRUList
 * is a doubly linked list consisting of BTree nodes. If a node participates
 * in an LRUList, then whenever it is accessed, it moves to the "back" of the
 * list. When eviction is needed, the evictor evicts the nodes at the "front"
 * of the LRULists.
 *
 * An LRUList is implemented as 2 IN references: a "front" ref pointing to the
 * IN at the front of the list and a "back" ref, pointing to the IN at the back
 * of the list. In addition, each IN has "nextLRUNode" and "prevLRUNode" refs
 * for participating in an LRUList. This implementation works because an IN can
 * belong to at most 1 LRUList at a time. Furthermore, it is the responsibility
 * of the Evictor to know which LRUList a node belongs to at any given time
 * (more on this below). As a result, each LRUList can assume that a node will
 * either not be in any list at all, or will belong to "this" list. This way,
 * membership of a node to an LRUList can be tested by just checking that
 * either the nextLRUNode or prevLRUNode field of the node is non-null.
 *
 * The operations on an LRUList are:
 *
 * - addBack(IN) : 
 * Insert an IN at the back of the list. Assert that the node does not belong
 * to an LRUList already.
 *
 * - addFront(IN) : 
 * Insert an IN at the front of the list.  Assert that the node does not belong
 * to an LRUList already.
 *
 * - moveBack(IN) :
 * Move an IN to the back of the list, if it is in the list already. Noop
 * if the node is not in the list.
 *
 * - moveFront(IN) : 
 * Move an IN to the front of the list, if it is in the list already. Noop
 * if the node is not in the list.
 *
 * - removeFront() : 
 * Remove the IN at the front of the list and return it to the caller. 
 * Return null if the list is empty.
 *
 * - remove(IN) : 
 * Remove the IN from the list, if it is there. Return true if the node was
 * in the list, false otherwise.
 *
 * - contains(IN):
 * Return true if the node is contained in the list, false otherwise.
 *
 * All of the above methods are synchronized on the LRUList object. This may
 * create a synchronization bottleneck. To alleviate this, the Evictor uses
 * multiple LRULists, which taken together comprise a logical LRU list, called
 * an LRUSet. The number of LRULists per LRUSet (numLRULists) is fixed and
 * determined by a config parameter (max of 64). The LRULists are stored in
 * an array whose length is numLRULists.
 *
 * The Evictor actually maintains 2 LRUSets: priority-1 and priority-2.
 * Within an LRUSet, the nodeId is used to place a node to an LRUList: a
 * node with id N goes to the (N % numLRULists)-th list. In addition, each
 * node has a flag (isInPri2LRU) to identify which LRUSet it belongs to.
 * This way, the Evictor knows which LRUList a node should belong to, and 
 * accesses the appropriate LRUList instance when it needs to add/remove/move
 * a node within the LRU.
 *
 * Access to the isInPri2LRU flag is synchronized via the SH/EX node latch.
 *
 * When there is no off-heap cache configured, the priority-1 LRU is the
 * "mixed" one and the priority-2 LRU is the "dirty" one. When there is an
 * off-heap cache configured, the priority-2 LRU is the "normal" one and the
 * priority-2 LRU is the "level-2" one.
 *
 * Justification for the mixed and dirty LRUSets: We would like to keep dirty
 * INs in memory as much as possible to achieve "write absorption". Ideally,
 * dirty INs should be logged by the checkpointer only. So, we would like to
 * have the option in the Evictor to chose a clean IN to evict over a dirty
 * IN, even if the dirty IN is colder than the clean IN. In this mode, having
 * a single LRUSet will not perform very well in the situation when most (or
 * a lot) or the INs are dirty (because each time we get a dirty IN from an
 * LRUList, we would have to put it back to the list and try another IN until
 * we find a clean one, thus spending a lot of CPU time trying to select an
 * eviction target).
 *
 * Justification for the normal and level-2 LRUSets: With an off-heap cache,
 * if level-2 INs were not treated specially, the main cache evictor may run
 * out of space and (according to LRU) evict a level 2 IN, even though the IN
 * references off-heap BINs (which will also be evicted). The problem is that
 * we really don't want to evict the off-heap BINs (or their LNs) when the
 * off-heap cache is not full. Therefore we only evict level-2 INs with
 * off-heap children when there are no other nodes that can be evicted. A
 * level-2 IN is moved to the priority-2 LRUSet when it is encountered by the
 * evictor in the priority-1 LRUSet.
 *
 * Within each LRUSet, picking an LRUList to evict from is done in a round-
 * robin fashion. To this end, the Evictor maintains 2 int counters:
 * nextPri1LRUList and nextPri2LRUList. To evict from the priority-1 LRUSet, an
 * evicting thread picks the (nextPri1LRUList % numLRULists)-th list, and
 * then increments nextPri1LRUList. Similarly, to evict from the priority-2
 * LRUSet, an evicting thread picks the (nextPri2LRUList % numLRULists)-th
 * list, and then increments nextPri2LRUList. This does not have to be done in
 * a synchronized way.
 *
 * A new flag (called hasCachedChildren) is added to each IN to indicate
 * whether the IN has cached children or not. This flag is used and maintained
 * for upper INs (UINs) only. The need for this flag is explained below.
 * Access to this flag is synchronized via the SH/EX node latch.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * LRUSet management: adding/removing/moving INs in/out of/within the LRUSets
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * We don't want to track upper IN (UIN) nodes that have cached children.
 * There are 2 reasons for this: (a) we cannot evict UINs with cached children
 * (the children must be evicted first) and (b) UINs will normally have high
 * access rate, and would add a lot of CPU overhead if they were tracked. 
 *
 * The hasCachedChildren flag is used as a quick way to determine whether a
 * UIN has cached children or not.
 *
 * Adding a node to the LRU.
 * -------------------------
 *
 * A IN N is added in an LRUSet via one of the following Evictor methods:
 * addBack(IN), addFront(IN), pri2AddBack(IN), or pri2AddFront(IN). The
 * first 2 add the node to the priority-1 LRUSet and set its isInPri2LRU flag
 * to false. The last 2 add the node to the priority-2 LRUSet and set its
 * isInPri2LRU flag to true.
 *
 * Note: DINs and DBINs are never added to the LRU.
 *
 * A node N is added to the LRU in the following situations:
 *
 * 1. N is fetched into memory from the log. Evictor.addBack(N) is called
 *    inside IN.postfetchInit() (just before N is connected to its parent).
 *
 * 2. N is a brand new node created during a split, and either N is a BIN or
 *    N does not get any cached children from its split sibling.
 *    Evictor.addFront(N) is called if N is a BIN and the cachemode is
 *    MAKE_COLD or EVICT_BIN. Otherwise, Evictor.addBack(child) is called.
 *
 * 3. N is a UIN that is being split, and before the split it had cached
 *    children, but all its cached children have now moved to its newly
 *    created sibling. Evictor.addBack(N) is called in this case.
 *
 * 4. N is a UIN that looses its last cached child (either because the child is
 *    evicted or it is deleted). Evictor.addBack(N) is called inside
 *    IN.setTarget(), if the target is null, N is a UIN, N's hasCachedChildren
 *    flag is true, and N after setting the target to null, N has no remaining
 *    cached children.
 *
 * 5. N is the 1st BIN in a brand new tree. In this case, Evictor.addBack(N)
 *    is called inside Tree.findBinForInsert().
 *
 * 6. N is a node visited during IN.rebuildINList() and N is either a BIN or
 *    a UIN with no cached children.
 *
 * 7. An evicting thread T removes N from the LRU, but after T EX-latches N,
 *    it determines that N is not evictable or should not be evicted, and
 *    should be put back in the LRU. T puts N back to the LRU using one of
 *    the above 4 methods (for details, read about the eviction processing
 *    below), but ONLY IF (a) N is still in the INList, and (b) N is not in
 *    the LRU already.
 *
 *    Case (b) can happen if N is a UIN and after T removed N from the LRU
 *    but before T could latch N, another thread T1 added a child to N and
 *    removed that child. Thus, by item 4 above, T1 adds N back to the LRU.
 *    Furthermore, since N is now back in the LRU, case (a) can now happen
 *    as well if another thread can evict N before T latches it.
 *
 * 8. When the checkpointer (or any other thread/operation) cleans a dirty IN,
 *    it must move it from the priority-2 LRUSet (if there) to the priority-1
 *    one. This is done via the Evictor.moveToPri1LRU(N) method: If the
 *    isInPri2LRU flag of N is true, LRUList.remove(N) is called to remove
 *    the node from the priority-2 LRUSet. If N was indeed in the priority-2
 *    LRUSet (i.e., LRUList.remove() returns true), addBack(N) is called to
 *    put it in the priority-1 LRUSet.
 *
 *    By moving N to the priority-1 LRUSet only after atomically removing it
 *    from the priority-2 LRUSet and checking that it was indeed there, we
 *    prevent N from being added into the LRU if N has been or would be removed
 *    from the LRU by a concurrently running evicting thread.
 *    
 * In cases 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 N is EX-latched. In case 1, the node is not
 * latched, but it is inaccessible by any other threads because it is not
 * connected to its parent yet and the parent is EX-latched (but N has already
 * been inserted in the INList; can this create any problems ?????). In case
 * 6 there is only one thread running. So, in all cases it's ok to set the
 * isInPri2LRU flag of the node.
 *
 * Question: can a thread T try to add a node N, seen as a Java obj instance,
 * into the LRU, while N is already there? I believe not, and LRUList addBack()
 * and addFront() methods assert that this cannot happen. In cases 1, 2, and 5
 * above N is newly created node, so it cannot be in the LRU already. In cases
 * 3 and 4, N is a UIN that has cached children, so it cannot be in the LRU.
 * In case 6 there is only 1 thread. Finally, in cases 7 and 8, T checks that
 * N is not in the LRU before attempting to add it (and the situation cannot
 * change between tis check and the insertion into the LRU because N is EX-
 * latched).
 *
 * Question: can a thread T try to add a node N, seen as a logical entity
 * represented by its nodeId, into the LRU, while N is already there?
 * Specifically, (a) can two Java instances, N1 and N2, of the same node
 * N exist in memory at the same time, and (b) while N1 is in the LRU, can
 * a thread T try to add N2 in the LRU? The answer to (a) is "yes", and as
 * far as I can think, the answer to (b) is "no", but there is no explicit
 * check in the code for this. Consider the following sequence of events:
 * Initially only N1 is in memory and in the LRU. An evicting thread T1
 * removes N1 from the LRU, thread T2 adds N1 in the LRU, thread T3 removes
 * N1 from the LRU and actually evicts it, thread T4 fetches N from the log,
 * thus creating instance N2 and adding N2 to the LRU, thread T1 finally
 * EX-latches N1 and has to decide what to do with it. The check in case
 * 7a above makes sure that N1 will not go back to the LRU. In fact the
 * same check makes sure that N1 will not be evicted (i.e., logged, if
 * dirty). T1 will just skip N1, thus allowing it to be GCed.
 *
 * Removing a node from the LRU
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * A node is removed from the LRU when it is selected as an eviction target
 * by an evicting thread. The thread chooses an LRUList list to evict from
 * and calls removeFront() on it. The node is not latched when it is removed
 * from the LRU in this case. The evicting thread is going to EX-latch the
 * node shortly after the removal. But as explain already earlier, between
 * the removal and the latching, another thread may put the node back to the
 * LRU, and as a result, another thread may also choose the same node for
 * eviction. The node may also be detached from the BTree, or its database
 * closed, or deleted.
 * 
 * A node may also be removing from the LRU by a non-evicting thread. This
 * is done via the Evictor.remove(IN) method. The method checks the node's
 * isInDrtryLRU flag to determine which LRUSet the node belongs to (if any)
 * and then calls LRUList.remove(N). The node must be at least SH latched
 * when the method is called. The method is a noop if the node is not in the
 * LRU. The node may not belong to any LRUList, because it has been selected
 * for eviction by another thread (and thus removed from LRU), but the
 * evicting thread has not yet latched the node. There are 3 cases (listed
 * below) where Evictor.remove(N) is called. In the first two cases
 * Evictor.remove(N) is invoked from INList.removeInternal(N). This makes
 * sure that N is removed from the LRU whenever it it removed from the
 * INList (to guarantee that the nodes in the LRU are always a subset of
 * the nodes in the INList).
 *
 * 1. When a tree branch containing N gets detached from its tree. In this
 *    case, INList.remove(N) is invoked inside accountForSubtreeRemoval() or
 *    accountForDeferredWriteSubtreeRemoval().
 * 
 * 2. When the database containing N gets deleted or truncated. In this case,
 *    INList.iter.remove() is called in DatabaseImpl.finishDeleteProcessing().
 *
 * 3. N is a UIN with no cached children (hasCachedChildren flag is false)
 *    and a new child for N is fetched. The call to Evictor.remove(N) is
 *    done inside IN.setTarget().
 *
 * Moving a node within the LRU
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * A node N is moved within its containing LRUList (if any) via the Evictor
 * moveBack(IN) and moveFront(IN) methods. The methods check the isInPri2LRU
 * flag of the node to determine the LRUSet the node belongs to and then move
 * the node to the back or to the front of the LRUList. The node will be at
 * least SH latched when these methods are called. Normally, the IN will be
 * in an LRUList. However, it may not belong to any LRUList, because it has
 * been selected for eviction by another thread (and thus removed from LRU),
 * but the evicting thread has not yet EX-latched the node. In this case,
 * these methods are is a noop. The methods are called in the following
 * situations:
 *
 * 1. N is latched with cachemode DEFAULT, KEEP_HOT, or EVICT_LN and N is a
 *    BIN or a UIN with no cached children (the hasCachedChildren flag is
 *    used to check if the UIN has cached children, so we don't need to
 *    iterate over all of the node's child entries). In this case,
 *    Evictor.moveBack(N) .
 *
 * 2. N is latched with cachemode MAKE_COLD or EVICT_BIN and N is a BIN.
 *    In this case, Evictor.moveFront(N) is called.
 * 
 * -------------------
 * Eviction Processing
 * -------------------
 *
 * A thread can initiate eviction by invoking the Evictor.doEviction() method.
 * This method implements an "eviction run". An eviction run consists of a
 * number of "eviction passes", where each pass is given as input a maximum
 * number of bytes to evict. An eviction pass is implemented by the
 * Evictor.evictBatch() method. 
 *
 * Inside Evictor.evictBatch(), an evicting thread T:
 * 
 * 1. Picks the priority-1 LRUset initially as the "current" LRUSet to be
 *    processed,
 *
 * 2. Initializes the max number of nodes to be processed per LRUSet to the
 *    current size of the priority-1 LRUSet,
 *
 * 3. Executes the following loop:
 *
 * 3.1. Picks a non-empty LRUList from the current LRUSet in a round-robin
 *      fashion, as explained earlier, and invokes LRUList.removeFront() to
 *      remove the node N at the front of the list. N becomes the current
 *      eviction target.
 *
 * 3.2. If the DB node N belongs to has been deleted or closed, skips this node,
 *      i.e., leaves N outside the LRU and goes to 3.4.
 *
 * 3.3. Calls ProcessTarget(N) (see below)
 *
 * 3.4. If the current LRUset is the priority-1 one and the number of target nodes
 *      processed reaches the max number allowed, the priority-2 LRUSet becomes
 *      the current one, the max number of nodes to be processed per LRUSet is
 *      set to the current size of the priority-2 LRUSet, and the number of
 *      nodes processed is reset to 0.
 *
 * 3.5. Breaks the loop if the max number of bytes to evict during this pass
 *      has been reached, or memConsumption is less than (maxMemory - M) (where
 *      M is a config param), or the number of nodes that have been processed
 *      in the current LRUSet reaches the max allowed.
 *
 * --------------------------
 * The processTarget() method
 * --------------------------
 *
 * This method is called after a node N has been selected for eviction (and as
 * result, removed from the LRU). The method EX-latches N and determines
 * whether it can/should really be evicted, and if not what is the appropriate
 * action to be taken by the evicting thread. Before returning, the method
 * unlatches N. Finally, it returns the number of bytes evicted (if any).
 *
 * If a decision is taken to evict N or mutate it to a BINDelta, N must first
 * be unlatched and its parent must be searched within the tree. During this
 * search, many things can happen to the unlatched N, and as a result, after
 * the parent is found and the N is relatched, processTarget() calls itself
 * recursively to re-consider all the possible actions for N.
 *
 * Let T be an evicting thread running processTarget() to determine what to do
 * with a target node N. The following is the list of possible outcomes:
 *
 * 1. SKIP - Do nothing with N if:
 *    (a) N is in the LRU. This can happen if N is a UIN and while it is
 *        unlatched by T, other threads fetch one or more of N's children,
 *        but then all of N's children are removed again, thus causing N to
 *        be put back to the LRU.
 *    (b) N is not in the INList. Given than N can be put back to the LRU while
 *        it is unlatched by T, it can also be selected as an eviction target
 *        by another thread and actually be evicted.
 *    (c) N is a UIN with cached children. N could have acquired children
 *        after the evicting thread removed it from the LRU, but before the
 *        evicting thread could EX-latch it.
 *    (d) N is the root of the DB naming tree or the DBmapping tree. 
 *    (e) N is dirty, but the DB is read-only.
 *    (f) N's environment used a shared cache and the environment has been
 *        closed or invalidated.
 *    (g) If a decision was taken to evict od mutate N, but the tree search
 *        (using N's keyId) to find N's parent, failed to find the parent, or
 *        N itself. This can happen if during the search, N was evicted by
 *        another thread, or a branch containing N was completely removed
 *        from the tree.
 *
 * 2. PUT BACK - Put N to the back of the LRUSet it last belonged to, if:
 *    (a) It is a BIN that was last accessed with KEEP_HOT cache mode.
 *    (b) N has an entry with a NULL LSN and a null target.
 *
 * 3. PARTIAL EVICT - perform partial eviction on N, if none of the cases
 *    listed above is true. Currently, partial eviction applies to BINs only
 *    and involves the eviction (stripping) of evictable LNs. If a cached LN
 *    is not  evictable, the whole BIN is not evictable as well. Currently,
 *    only MapLNs may be non-evictable (see MapLN.isEvictable()).
 *
 *    After partial eviction is performed the following outcomes are possible:
 *
 * 4. STRIPPED PUT BACK - Put N to the back of the LRUSet it last belonged to,
 *    if partial eviction did evict any bytes, and N is not a BIN in EVICT_BIN
 *    or MAKE_COLD cache mode.
 *
 * 5. PUT BACK - Put N to the back of the LRUSet it last belonged to, if
 *    no bytes were stripped, but partial eviction determined that N is not
 *    evictable.
 *
 * 6. MUTATE - Mutate N to a BINDelta, if none of the above apply and N is a
 *    BIN that can be mutated.
 *
 * 7. MOVE DIRTY TO PRI-2 LRU - Move N to the front of the priority-2 LRUSet,
 *    if none of the above apply and N is a dirty node that last belonged to
 *    the priority-1 LRUSet, and a dirty LRUSet is used (meaning that no
 *    off-heap cache is configured).
 *
 * 8. MOVE LEVEL-2 TO PRI-2 LRU - Move N to the front of the priority-2 LRUSet,
 *    if none of the above apply and N is a level-2 node with off-heap BINs
 *    that last belonged to the priority-1 LRUSet.
 *
 * 9. EVICT - Evict N is none of the above apply.

 * TODO:

 * 1. Decide what to do about assertions (keep, remove, convert to JE
 *    exceptions, convert to DEBUG-only expensive checks).
