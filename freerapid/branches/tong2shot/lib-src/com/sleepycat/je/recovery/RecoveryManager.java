/**
 * Performs recovery when an Environment is opened.
 *
 * TODO: Need a description of the recovery algorithm here.  For some related
 * information, see the Checkpointer class comments.
 *
 * Recovery, the INList and Eviction
 * =================================
 * There are two major steps in recovery: 1) recover the mapping database and
 * the INs for all other databases, 2) recover the LNs for the other databases.
 * In the buildTree method, step 1 comes before the call to buildINList and
 * step 2 comes after that.  The INList is not maintained in step 1.
 *
 * The INList is not maintained in the step 1 because there is no benefit -- we
 * cannot evict anyway as explained below -- and there are potential drawbacks
 * to maintaining it: added complexity and decreased performance.  The
 * drawbacks are described in more detail further below.
 *
 * Even if the INList were maintained in step 1, eviction could not be enabled
 * until step 2, because logging is not allowed until all the INs are in place.
 * In principle we could evict non-dirty nodes in step 1, but since recovery is
 * dirtying the tree as it goes, there would be little or nothing that is
 * non-dirty and could be evicted.
 *
 * Therefore, the INList has an 'enabled' mode that is initially false (in step
 * 1) and is set to true by buildINList, just before step 2.  The mechanism for
 * adding nodes to the INList is skipped when it is disabled.  In addition to
 * enabling it, buildINList populates it from the contents of the Btrees that
 * were constructed in step 1.  In step 2, eviction is invoked explicitly by
 * calling EnvironmentImpl.invokeEvictor often during recovery.  This is
 * important since the background evictor thread is not yet running.
 *
 * An externally visible limitation created by this situation is that the nodes
 * placed in the Btree during step 1 must all fit in memory, since no eviction
 * is performed.  So memory is a limiting factor in how large a recovery can be
 * performed.  Since eviction is allowed in step 2, and step 2 is where the
 * bulk of the recovery is normally performed, this limitation of step 1 hasn't
 * been a critical problem.
 *
 * Maintaining the INList
 * ----------------------
 * In this section we consider the impact of maintaining the INList in step 1,
 * if this were done in a future release.  It is being considered for a future
 * release so we can rely on the INList to reference INs by node ID in the
 * in-memory representation of an IN (see the Big Memory SR [#22292]).
 *
 * To maintain the INList in step 1, when a branch of a tree (a parent IN) is
 * spliced in, the previous branch (all of the previous node's children) would
 * have to be removed from the INList.  Doing this incorrectly could cause an
 * OOME, and it may also have a performance impact.
 *
 * The performance impact of removing the previous branch from the INList is
 * difficult to estimate.  In the normal case (recovery after normal shutdown),
 * very few nodes will be replaced because normally only nodes at the max flush
 * level are replayed, and the slots they are placed into will be empty (not
 * resident).  Here is description of a worst case scenario, which is when
 * there is a crash near the end of a checkpoint:
 *
 *  + The last checkpoint is large, includes all nodes in the tree, is mostly
 *    complete, but was not finished (no CkptEnd).  The middle INs (above BIN
 *    and below the max flush level) must be replayed (see Checkpointer and
 *    Provisional.BEFORE_CKPT_END).
 *
 *  + For these middle INs, the INs at each level are placed in the tree and
 *    replace any IN present in the slot.  For the bottom-most level of middle
 *    INs (level 2), these don't replace a node (the slot will be empty because
 *    BINs are never replayed).  But for the middle INs in all levels above
 *    that, they replace a node that was fetched earlier; it was fetched
 *    because it is the parent of a node at a lower level that was replayed.
 *
 *  + In the worst case, all INs from level 3 to R-1, where R is the root
 *    level, would be replayed and replace a node.  However, it seems the
 *    replaced node would not have resident children in the scenario described,
 *    so the cost of removing it from the INList does not seem excessive.
 *
 *  + Here's an example illustrating this scenario.  The BINs and their parents
 *    (as a sub-tree) are logged first, followed by all dirty INs at the next
 *    level, etc.
 *
 *    0050 CkptStart
 *    0100 BIN level 1
 *    0200 BIN level 1
 *    ...
 *    1000 IN level 2, parent of 0100, 0200, etc.
 *    1100 BIN level 1
 *    1200 BIN level 1
 *    ...
 *    2000 IN level 2, parent of 1100, 1200, etc.
 *    ...
 *    7000 IN level 2, last level 2 IN logged
 *    8000 IN level 3, parent of 1000, 2000, etc.
 *    ...
 *    9000 IN level 4, parent of 8000, etc.
 *    ...
 *    
 *                  9000       level 4
 *                 /
 *            ----8000----     level 3
 *           /  /         \
 *       1000  2000    ......  level 2
 *
 *                             BINs not shown
 *
 *    Only the root (if it happens to be logged right before the crash) is
 *    non-provisional.  We'll assume in this example that the root was not
 *    logged.  Level 2 through R-1 are logged as Provisional.BEFORE_CKPT_END,
 *    and treated as non-provisional (replayed) by recovery because there is no
 *    CkptEnd.
 *
 *    When 1000 (and all other nodes at level 2) is replayed, it is placed into
 *    an empty slot.
 *
 *    When 8000 (and all other INs at level 3 and higher, below the root) is
 *    replayed, it will replace a resident node that was fetched and placed in
 *    the slot when replaying its children.  The replaced node is one not
 *    shown, and assumed to have been logged sometime prior to this checkpoint.
 *    The replaced node will have all the level 2 nodes that were replayed
 *    earlier (1000, 2000, etc.) as its resident children, and these are the
 *    nodes that would have to be removed from the INList, if recovery were
 *    changed to place INs on the INList in step 1.
 *
 *    So if the INs were placed on the INList, in this worst case scenario, all
 *    INs from level 3 to R-1 will be replayed, and all their immediate
 *    children would need to be removed from the INList.  Grandchildren would
 *    not be resident.  In other words, all nodes at level 2 and above (except
 *    the root) would be removed from the INList and replaced by a node being
 *    replayed.
 *
 * When there is a normal shutdown, we don't know of scenarios that would cause
 * this sort of INList thrashing.  So perhaps maintaining the INList in step 1
 * could be justified, if the additional recovery cost after a crash is
 * acceptable.
 *
 * Or, a potential solution for the worst case scenario above might be to place
 * the resident child nodes in the new parent, rather than discarding them and
 * removing them from the INList.  This would have the benefit of populating
 * the cache and not wasting the work done to read and replay these nodes.
 * OTOH, it may cause OOME if too much of the tree is loaded in step 1.

         * always call countObsoleteIfUncounted(AL, T-cmt). In relatively
         * rare scenarios, this can result in failing to count AL as obsolete.
         * Consider the following cases:
         *
         * TL < L
         * -------
         *
         * If TL < L we don't call countObsoleteIfUncounted() on AL, because
         * in most cases this has been done already during the current RedoLNs
         * pass or AL was counted durably as obsolete during normal processing.
         * The reasoning is as follows. As explained above, if TL < L, one of
         * the following is true:
         *
         * (a) TL == AL.
         *
         *     TL/AL --- TT-cmt --- L --- (FSLN)? --- T-cmt
         *
         *     countObsoleteIfUncounted(TL, L) was called above. If FSLN
         *     exists, this call did not count TL. However, FSLN does not
         *     contain TL, because it is T-cmt that recorded TL as obsolete.
         *     Therefore, assuming no other FSLN exists after T-cmt, we miss
         *     counting TL by not calling countObsoleteIfUncounted(TL, T-cmt).
         *
         *     However, in most cases, there won't be any FSLN between L and
         *     T-cmt, or there will be another FLSN after T-cmt. As a result,
         *     the countObsoleteIfUncounted(TL, L) call suffices. Therefore,
         *     we prefer to occasionally miss an abortLSN than doing too much
         *     double counting.
         *
         * (b1) T == TT and TL < ckpt_start. In
         *
         *      AL --- TL --- ckpt-start --- L --- T-cmt --- (FSLN)?
         *
         *      TL and L have the same abortLSN and the same commitLSN. TL is
         *      not processed during this RedoLNs pass, so unless an FSLN was
         *      logged during normal processing after T-cmt, we miss counting
         *      AL. Notice that an FSLN will exist if T-cmt occurs before
         *      ckpt-end, which is the more common case.
         *
         * (b2) T == TT and TL > ckpt_start
         *
         *      ckpt-start --- TL --- L --- (FSLN-1)? --- T-cmt --- (FSLN)?
         *
         *      TL and L have the same abortLSN and the same commitLSN.
         *      Furthermore, TL was processed during the current RedoLNs pass.
         *      We assume that what ever was done about AL during the
         *      processing of TL was correct and we don't repeat it.
         *
         * L < TL
         * -------
         *
         * (a) ckpt_start --- AL --- L --- T-cmt --- (FSLN)? --- TL --- (FSLN)?
         *
         *     AL was processed earlier in this RedoLNs pass. When it was
         *     processed, it was < TL, so countObsoleteIfUncounted(AL, TL)
         *     was called. There is no reason to count again.
         *
         * (b) ckpt_start --- AL --- L --- TL --- (FSLN))? --- T-cmt --- (FSLN)?
         *
         *     AL was processed earlier in this RedoLNs pass. When it was
         *     processed, it was < TL, so countObsoleteIfUncounted(AL, TL)
         *     was called. To avoid double counting, we will not call
         *     countObsoleteIfUncounted(AL, t-cmt). However, in this case
         *     we will fail counting AL as obsolete if there is an FSLN
         *     between TL and T-cmt and no FSLN after T-cmt.
         *
         * (c) AL --- ckpt_start --- L --- TL
         *
         *     In this case we call countObsoleteIfUncounted(AL, t-cmt)
         *
         * L == TL
         * -------

         * (a) ckpt_start --- AL --- L/TL --- (FSLN)? --- T-cmt --- (FSLN)?
