/**
 * <p>
 * This exception is thrown at the time of a commit in a Master, if the Master
 * could not obtain transaction commit acknowledgments from its Replicas in
 * accordance with the {@link ReplicaAckPolicy} currently in effect and within
 * the requested timeout interval. This exception will never be thrown when the
 * {@code ReplicaAckPolicy} of {@link ReplicaAckPolicy#NONE NONE} is in effect.
 * <p>
 * Note that an {@link InsufficientAcksException} means the transaction has
 * already committed at the master. The transaction may also have been
 * committed at one or more Replicas, but the lack of replica acknowledgments
 * means that the number of replicas that committed could not be
 * established. If the transaction was in fact committed by less than a simple
 * majority of the nodes, it could result in a {@link RollbackException} when
 * the node subsequently attempts to rejoin the group as a Replica.
 * <p>
 * The application can handle the exception and choose to respond in a number
 * of ways. For example, it can
 * <ul>
 * <li>do nothing, assuming that the transaction will eventually propagate to
 * enough replicas to become durable,
 * <li>retry the operation in a new transaction, which may succeed or fail
 * depending on whether the underlying problems have been resolved,
 * <li>retry using a larger timeout interval and return to the original
 * timeout interval at a later time,
 * <li>fall back temporarily to a read-only mode,
 * <li>increase the durability of the transaction on the Master by ensuring
 * that the changes are flushed to the operating system's buffers or to
 * the disk, or
 * <li>give up and report an error at a higher level, perhaps to allow an
 * administrator to check the underlying cause of the failure.
 * </ul>
