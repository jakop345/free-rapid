/**
 * Tree implements the JE B+Tree.
 *
 * A note on tree search patterns:
 * There's a set of Tree.search* methods. Some clients of the tree use
 * those search methods directly, whereas other clients of the tree
 * tend to use methods built on top of search.
 *
 * The semantics of search* are
 *   they leave you pointing at a BIN or IN
 *   they don't tell you where the reference of interest is.
 * The semantics of the get* methods are:
 *   they leave you pointing at a BIN or IN
 *   they return the index of the slot of interest
 *   they traverse down to whatever level is needed
 *   they are built on top of search* methods.
 * For the future:
 * Over time, we need to clarify which methods are to be used by clients
 * of the tree. Preferably clients that call the tree use get*, although
 * their are cases where they need visibility into the tree structure.
 *
 * Also, search* should return the location of the slot to save us a
 * second binary search.
 *
 * Search Method Call Hierarchy
 * ----------------------------
 * getFirst/LastNode
 *  search
 *  CALLED BY:
 *   CursorImpl.getFirstOrLast
 *
 * getNext/PrevBin
 *  getParentINForChildIN
 *  searchSubTree
 *  CALLED BY:
 *   DupConvert
 *   CursorImpl.getNext
 *
 * getParentINForChildIN
 *  IN.findParent
 *  does not use shared latching
 *  CALLED BY:
 *   Checkpointer.flushIN (doFetch=false, targetLevel=-1)
 *   FileProcessor.processIN (doFetch=true, targetLevel=LEVEL)
 *   Evictor.evictIN (doFetch=true, targetLevel=-1)
 *   RecoveryManager.replaceOrInsertChild (doFetch=true, targetLevel=-1)
 *   getNext/PrevBin (doFetch=true, targetLevel=-1)
 *
 * search
 *  searchSubTree
 *  CALLED BY:
 *   CursorImpl.searchAndPosition
 *   INCompressor to find BIN
 *
 * searchSubTree
 *  uses shared grandparent latching
 *
 * getParentBINForChildLN
 *  searchSplitsAllowed
 *   CALLED BY:
 *    RecoveryManager.redo
 *    RecoveryManager.recoveryUndo
 *  search
 *   CALLED BY:
 *    RecoveryManager.abortUndo
 *    RecoveryManager.rollbackUndo
 *    FileProcessor.processLN
 *    Cleaner.processPendingLN
 *    UtilizationProfile.verifyLsnIsObsolete (utility)
 *
 * findBinForInsert
 *  searchSplitsAllowed
 *  CALLED BY:
 *   CursorImpl.putInternal
 *
 * searchSplitsAllowed
 *  uses shared non-grandparent latching
 *  CALLED BY:
 *   DupConvert (instead of findBinForInsert, which needs a cursor)
 *
 * Possible Shared Latching Improvements
 * -------------------------------------
 * By implementing shared latching for BINs we would get better concurrency in
 * these cases:
 *  Reads when LN is in cache, or LN is not needed (key-only op, e.g., dups)

    /**
     * Search for the parent P of a given IN C (where C is viewed as a logical
     * node; not as a java obj). If found, P is returned latched exclusively.
     * The method is used when C has been accessed "directly", i.e., not via a
     * tree search, and we need to perform an operation on C that requires an
     * update to its parent. Such situations arise during eviction (C has been
     * accessed via the LRU list), checkpointing, and recovery (C has been read
     * from the log and is not attached to the in-memory tree).
     *
     * The method uses C's identifierKey to search down the tree until:
     *
     * (a) doFetch is false and we need to access a node that is not cached.
     * In this case, we are actually looking for the cached copies of both C
     * and its parent, so a cache miss on the path to C is considered a 
     * failure. This search mode is used by the evictor: to evict C (which has
     * been retrieved from the LRU), its parent must be found and EX-latched;
     * however, if the C has been evicted already by another thread, there is
     * nothing to do (C will GC-ed).
     * or
     * (b) We reach a node whose node id equals the C's node id. In this case,
     * we know for sure that C still belongs to the BTree and its parent has
     * been found.
     * or
     * (c) useTargetLevel is true and we reach a node P that is at one level
     * above C's level. We know that P contains a slot S whose corresponding
     * key range includes C's identifierKey. Since we haven't read the child
     * node under S to check its node id, we cannot know for sure that C is
     * still in the tree. Nevertheless, we consider this situation a success,
     * i.e., P is the parent node we are looking for. In this search mode,
     * after this method returns, the caller is expected to take further
     * action based on the info in slot S. For example, if C was created
     * by reading a log entry at LSN L, and the LSN at slot S is also L, then
     * we know P is the real parent (and we have thus saved a possible extra
     * I/O to refetch the C node from the log to check its node id). This
     * search mode is used by the cleaner.
     * or
     * (d) None of the above conditions occur and the bottom of the BTree is
     * reached. In this case, no parent exists (the child node is an old 
     * version of a node that has been removed from the BTree).
     *
     * @param child The child node for which to find the parent.  This node is
     * latched by the caller and is unlatched by this function before returning
     * to the caller.
     *
     * @param useTargetLevel If true, the search is considered successful if
     * a node P is reached at one level above C's level. P is the parent to
     * return to the caller.
     *
     * @param doFetch if false, stop the search if we run into a non-resident
     * child and assume that no parent exists.
     *
     * @param cacheMode The CacheMode for affecting the hotness of the nodes
     * visited during the search.
     *
     * @return a SearchResult object. If the parent has been found,
     * result.foundExactMatch is true, result.parent refers to that node, and
     * result.index is the slot for the child IN inside the parent IN.
     * Otherwise, result.foundExactMatch is false and  result.parent is null.

     * going to insert the key in the BIN-delta, if not already there,
     * essentially overwritting the slot that may exist in the full BIN. So,
     * if blindDeltaOps is true, the method will not mutate a BIN-delta parent
     * (unless the BIN-delta has no space for a slot insertion).
     *
     * @param cacheMode The CacheMode for affecting the hotness of the tree.
     *
     * @return true if node found in tree.
     * If false is returned and there is the possibility that we can insert
