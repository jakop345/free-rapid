/**
 * The root of all BDB JE-defined exceptions.
 *
 * <p>Exceptions thrown by BDB JE fall into three categories.</p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>When a method is used incorrectly as the result of an application
 * programming error, a standard Java runtime exception is thrown: {@link
 * IllegalArgumentException}, {@link IllegalStateException} or {@link
 * UnsupportedOperationException}.  These exceptions have the standard meaning
 * defined by their javadoc.  Note that JE throws {@link
 * IllegalArgumentException} rather than {@link NullPointerException} when a
 * required parameter is null.
 * </li>
 * <li>When an operation failure occurs, {@link OperationFailureException} or
 * one of its subclasses is thrown.  See {@link OperationFailureException} for
 * details.
 * </li>
 * <li>When an {@code Environment} failure occurs, {@link
 * EnvironmentFailureException} or one of its subclasses is thrown.  See {@link
 * EnvironmentFailureException} for details.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>{@link OperationFailureException} and {@link EnvironmentFailureException}
 * are the only two direct subclasses of {@code DatabaseException}.</p>
 *
 * <p>(Actually the above statement is not strictly correct.  {@link
 * EnvironmentFailureException} extends {@link RunRecoveryException} which
 * extends {@code DatabaseException}.  {@link RunRecoveryException} exists for
 * backward compatibility and has been deprecated. {@link
 * EnvironmentFailureException} should be used instead.)</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that in some cases, certain methods return status values without
 * issuing an exception. This occurs in situations that are not normally
 * considered an error, but when some informational status is returned.  For
 * example, {@link com.sleepycat.je.Database#get Database.get} returns {@link
 * com.sleepycat.je.OperationStatus#NOTFOUND OperationStatus.NOTFOUND} when a
 * requested key does not appear in the database.</p>
