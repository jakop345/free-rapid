/*
 * The FsyncManager ensures that only one file fsync is issued at a time, for
 * performance optimization. The goal is to reduce the number of fsyncs issued
 * by the system by issuing 1 fsync on behalf of a number of threads.
 *
 * For example, suppose these writes happen which all need to be fsynced to
 * disk:
 *
 *  thread 1 writes a commit record
 *  thread 2 writes a checkpoint
 *  thread 3 writes a commit record
 *  thread 4 writes a commit record
 *  thread 5 writes a checkpoint
 *
 * Rather than executing 5 fsyncs, which all must happen synchronously, we hope
 * to issue fewer. How many fewer depend on timing. Note that the writes
 * themselves are serialized and are guaranteed to run in order.
 *
 * For example:
 *    thread 1 wants to fsync first, no other fsync going on, will issue fsync
 *    thread 2 waits
 *    thread 3 waits
 *    thread 4 waits
 *     - before thread 5 comes, thread 1 finishes fsyncing and returns to
 *     the caller. Now another fsync can be issued that will cover threads
 *     2,3,4. One of those threads (2, 3, 4} issues the fsync, the others
 *     block.
 *    thread 5 wants to fsync, but sees one going on, so will wait.
 *     - the fsync issued for 2,3,4 can't cover thread 5 because we're not sure
 *      if thread 5's write finished before that fsync call. Thread 5 will have
 *      to issue its own fsync.
 *
 * Target file
 * -----------
 * Note that when the buffer pool starts a new file, we fsync the previous file
 * under the log write latch. Therefore, at any time we only have one target
 * file to fsync, which is the current write buffer. We do this so that we
 * don't have to coordinate between files.  For example, suppose log files have
 * 1000 bytes and a commit record is 10 bytes.  An LSN of value 6/990 is in
 * file 6 at offset 990.
 *
 * thread 1: logWriteLatch.acquire()
 *         write commit record to LSN 6/980
 *         logWriteLatch.release()
 * thread 2: logWriteLatch.acquire()
 *         write commit record to LSN 6/990
 *         logWriteLatch.release
 * thread 3: logWriteLatch.acquire()
 *         gets 7/000 as the next LSN to use
 *          see that we flipped to a new file, so call fsync on file 6
 *         write commit record to LSN 7/000
 *         logWriteLatch.release()
 *
 * Thread 3 will fsync file 6 within the log write latch. That way, at any
 * time, any non-latched fsyncs should only fsync the latest file.  If we
 * didn't do, there's the chance that thread 3 would fsync file 7 and return to
 * its caller before the thread 1 and 2 got an fsync for file 6. That wouldn't
 * be correct, because thread 3's commit might depend on file 6.
 *
 * Note that the FileManager keeps a file descriptor that corresponds to the
 * current end of file, and that is what we fsync.

     * 2. wake up one member of the next group of waiting threads (the
     *    nextFsyncWaiters) so that thread can become the new leader
     *    and issue the next flush/fysnc call.
