/**
 * Modes that can be specified for control over caching of records in the JE
 * in-memory cache.  When a record is stored or retrieved, the cache mode
 * determines how long the record is subsequently retained in the JE in-memory
 * cache, relative to other records in the cache.
 *
 * <p>When the cache overflows, JE must evict some records from the cache.  By
 * default, JE uses a Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm for determining which
 * records to evict.  With the LRU algorithm, JE makes a best effort to evict
 * the "coldest" (least recently used or accessed) records and to retain the
 * "hottest" records in the cache for as long as possible.</p>
 *
 * <p>When an {@link EnvironmentMutableConfig#setOffHeapCacheSize off-heap
 * cache} is configured, records evicted from the main cache are placed in
 * the off-heap cache, and a separate LRU is used to determine when to evict
 * a record from the off-heap cache.</p>
 *
 * <p>JE uses an approximate LRU approach with some exceptions and special
 * cases.</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         Individual records (LNs or Leaf Nodes) do not appear on the LRU
 *         list, i.e., their "hotness" is not explicitly tracked. Instead,
 *         their containing Btree node (BIN or bottom internal node) appears on
 *         the LRU list. Each BIN contains roughly 100 LNs
 *         (see {@link com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentConfig#NODE_MAX_ENTRIES}).
 *         When an LN is accessed, its BIN is moved to the hot end of the LRU
 *         list, implying that all other LNs in the same BIN also are treated
 *         as if they are hot. The same applies if the BIN is moved to the cold
 *         end of the LRU list. The above statement applies to the off-heap
 *         cache also, when one is configured.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         When a BIN contains LNs and the BIN reaches the cold end of the LRU
 *         list, memory can be reclaimed by evicting the LNs, and eviction of
 *         the BIN is deferred. The empty BIN is moved to the hot end of the
 *         LRU list. When an off-heap cache is configured, the eviction of LNs
 *         in this manner occurs independently in both caches.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         When a BIN contains no LNs, it may be evicted entirely. When the
 *         BINs parent node becomes empty, it may also be evicted, and so on.
 *         The BINs and INs are evicted on the basis of an LRU, but with two
 *         exceptions:
 *         <p>
 *         1) Dirty BINs and INs are evicted only after eviction of all
 *         non-dirty BINs and INs. This is important to reduce logging and
 *         associated cleaning costs. When an off-heap cache is configured,
 *         BINs and INs are evicted from the main cache without regard to
 *         whether they are dirty. Dirty BINs and INs are evicted last, as
 *         just described, only from the off-heap cache.
 *         <p>
 *         2) A BIN may be mutated to a BIN-delta to reclaim memory, rather
 *         then being evicted entirely. A BIN-delta contains only the dirty
 *         entries (for LNs recently logged). A BIN-delta is used when its
 *         size relative to the full BIN will be small enough so that it will
 *         be more efficient, both on disk and in memory, to store the delta
 *         rather than the full BIN.
 *         (see {@link com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentConfig#TREE_BIN_DELTA}).
 *         The advantage of keeping a BIN-delta in cache is that some
 *         operations, particularly record insertions, can be performed using
 *         the delta without having the complete BIN in cache. When a BIN is
 *         mutated to a BIN-delta to reclaim memory, it is placed at the hot
 *         end of the LRU list. When an off-heap cache is configured, BINs are
 *         not mutated to BIN-deltas in the main cache, but rather this is done
 *         only in the off-heap cache.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         To reduce contention among threads on the LRU list, multiple LRU
 *         lists may be configured. See
 *         {@link com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentConfig#EVICTOR_N_LRU_LISTS}.
 *         As described in the javadoc for this parameter, there is a trade-off
 *         between thread contention and the accuracy of the LRU. This
 *         parameter determines the number of main cache LRU lists as well as
 *         the number of off-heap cache LRU lists, when an off-heap cache is
 *         configured.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *          A non-default cache mode may be explicitly specified to override
 *          the LRU behavior. See the CacheMode enumeration values for details.
 *          the normal LRU behavior described above. See the CacheMode
 *          enumeration values for details. The behavior of each CacheMode
 *          when an off-heap cache is configured is also described.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When no cache mode is explicitly specified, the default cache mode is
 * {@link #DEFAULT}. The default mode causes the normal LRU algorithm to be
 * used.</p>
 *
 * <p>An explicit cache mode may be specified as an {@link
 * EnvironmentConfig#setCacheMode Environment property}, a {@link
 * DatabaseConfig#setCacheMode Database property}, or a {@link
 * Cursor#setCacheMode Cursor property}.  If none are specified, {@link
 * #DEFAULT} is used.  If more than one non-null property is specified, the
 * Cursor property overrides the Database and Environment properties, and the
 * Database property overrides the Environment property.</p>
 *
 * <p>When all records in a given Database, or all Databases, should be treated
 * the same with respect to caching, using the Database and/or Environment
 * cache mode properties is sufficient. For applications that need finer
 * grained control, the Cursor cache mode property can be used to provide a
 * specific cache mode for individual records or operations.  The Cursor cache
 * mode property can be changed at any time, and the cache mode specified will
 * apply to subsequent operations performed with that Cursor.</p>
 *
 * <p>In a Replicated Environment where a non-default cache mode is desired,
 * the cache mode can be configured on the Master node as described above.
 * However, it is important to configure the cache mode on the Replica nodes
 * using an Environment property.  That way, the cache mode will apply to
 * <em>write</em> operations that are replayed on the Replica for all
 * Databases, even if the Databases are not open by the application on the
 * Replica.  Since all nodes may be Replicas at some point in their life cycle,
 * it is recommended to configure the desired cache mode as an Environment
 * property on all nodes in a Replicated Environment.</p>
 *
 * <p>On a Replica, per-Database control over the cache mode for <em>write</em>
 * operations is possible by opening the Database on the Replica and
 * configuring the cache mode.  Per-Cursor control (meaning per-record or
 * per-operation) control of the cache mode is not possible on a Replica for
 * <em>write</em> operations.  For <em>read</em> operations, both per-Database
 * and per-Cursor control is possible on the Replica, as described above.</p>
 * <p> 
 * The cache related stats in {@link EnvironmentStats} can provide some measure
 * of the effectiveness of the cache mode choice.
