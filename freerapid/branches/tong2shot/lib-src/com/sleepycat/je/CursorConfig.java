    /**
     * Configures the behavior of the cursor when a cursor movement operation
     * returns {@link OperationStatus#NOTFOUND}.
     *
     * By default, a cursor is "sticky", meaning that the prior position is
     * maintained by cursor movement operations, and the cursor stays at the
     * prior position when {@code NOTFOUND} is returned or an exception is
     * thrown. For example, if {@link Cursor#getFirst} is called successfully,
     * and then {@link Cursor#getNext} is called, if {@code getNext} returns
     * {@code NOTFOUND} the cursor will remain positioned on the first record.
     * <p>
     * Also, as part of maintaining the prior position, the lock on the record
     * at the current position will be held (at least) until after a cursor
     * movement operation succeeds and acquires a lock on the record at the new
     * position.  In the example above, a lock on the first record will still
     * be held after {@code getNext} returns {@code NOTFOUND}.
     * <p>
     * If the cursor is configured to be non-sticky, the prior position is
     * not maintained, and this has certain performance advantages:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>
     *     Some processing is avoided because the prior position is not
     *     maintained.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *     The lock on the record at the prior position is released before
     *     acquiring the lock on the record at the new position (when the
     *     cursor movement operation succeeds.) This can help to prevent
     *     deadlocks in certain situations. Namely, if the cursor's isolation
     *     mode allows locks to be released when moving to a new position, then
     *     only one lock at a time will be held by the cursor. Holding multiple
     *     locks at a time can cause deadlocks, when locks are acquired in
     *     different orders by different threads, for example, when one cursor
     *     is scanning forward and another cursor is scanning backward. Note
     *     that this optimization does not apply to repeatable-read or
     *     serializable isolation, since these modes require that locks are
     *     not released by cursor movement operations.
     *     </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * However, when the cursor is configured as non-sticky and {@code getNext}
     * returns {@code NOTFOUND} in the example above, the cursor position will
     * be uninitialized, as if it had just been opened. Also, the lock on the
     * first record will have been released (except when repeatable-read or
     * serializable isolation is configured.) To move to the first record (and
     * lock it), {@code getFirst} must be called again.
     * <p>
     * Also note that in certain circumstances, internal algorithms require
     * that the prior position is retained, and the operation will behave as if
     * the cursor is sticky. Specifically, these are only the following
     * methods, and only when called on a database with duplicates configured:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>{@link Cursor#putNoOverwrite}</li>
     *     <li>{@link Cursor#getNextDup}}</li>
     *     <li>{@link Cursor#getPrevDup}}</li>
     *     <li>{@link Cursor#getNextNoDup}}</li>
     *     <li>{@link Cursor#getPrevNoDup}}</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param nonSticky if false (the default), the prior position is
     * maintained by cursor movement operations, and the cursor stays at the
     * prior position when {@code NOTFOUND} is returned. If true, the prior
     * position is not maintained, and the cursor is reinitialized when
     * {@code NOTFOUND} is returned.
